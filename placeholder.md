# Image Placeholder Instructions

To complete the FocusPaws application, you'll need to create and add the following cat-themed images to the `img` folder:

## Required Images

1. **pawshield.png** - A logo showing a cat paw with a shield design
2. **cat-working.png** - A cat focusing on work (perhaps with glasses, typing)
3. **cat-resting.png** - A cat taking a break (sleeping, stretching)
4. **cat-waiting.png** - A cat in waiting pose (looking at watch or clock)
5. **cat-idle.png** - A cat in neutral position
6. **cat-celebration.png** - A cat celebrating (party hat, confetti)
7. **cat-no.png** - A cat blocking access (paw up like "stop")
8. **cat-tabby.png** - A tabby cat character
9. **cat-siamese.png** - A siamese cat character
10. **cat-calico.png** - A calico cat character

You can create these images using:
- Original artwork
- Free stock photos or vectors
- AI image generators with appropriate licensing

For a consistent style, consider using a similar art style for all cat images, such as cartoon-style or simple vector illustrations.

Remember to size all images appropriately:
- Logo: Around 40-50px height
- Cat characters: Around 150-200px height
- Celebration cat: Around 100px height
- Blocking cat: Around 200px width

Once you have these images, replace this placeholder file with the actual image files.
